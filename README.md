Schedulr

> ⚠️ Early concept This is an idea for a self-hosted planning assistant, not a finished product. Feedback, questions, or collaboration ideas are welcome—open an issue or start a conversation.



Schedulr is your open-source, privacy-respecting planning assistant. It helps you actually make time for the stuff on your to-do list—without farming your data or making you subscribe to a new productivity cult.

It’s built to run locally, be fully self-hosted, and work with tools you already use. No cloud lock-in, no weird logins, no spying.

Schedulr reads your tasks (from GitTasks, GitHub Issues, or Markdown), asks some smart questions, and helps you turn those into real, scheduled blocks on your calendar. It’s triage + planning + calendar automation—but under your control.

What makes it different

Open source: MIT licensed, inspect every line

Private: Run it offline or on your own hardware

Self-hosted: Deploy it to a server, Pi, or air-gapped laptop

Interoperable: Works with GitHub, Markdown, CalDAV, and more


This isn’t a “smart planner” that hides your life in an AI black box. It’s a tool that helps you think clearly, plan realistically, and ship more.


---

What it might do (MVP goals)

Read tasks from GitTasks, GitHub Issues, or plain text

Guide you through priority, time estimate, deadline, and focus level

Help you block out time in Google Calendar or any CalDAV-compatible calendar (like Nextcloud)

Nudge you with optional daily summaries or check-ins



---

What it won’t do

Sell your data

Send everything to OpenAI without your say-so

Force you into someone else’s system

Pretend your day has 38 hours in it



---

Future ideas

CLI and web-based “daily planner” flow

Offline-first PWA

More calendar integrations (ICS, iCal, time-tracking)

Priority matrix visualizer

Local agent integration for smarter nudges (e.g. Glyph)



---

Pair it with

GitTasks for task syncing from GitHub and Markdown

Tasks.org or Nextcloud Tasks for mobile + calendar sync

Your favorite distraction blocker
