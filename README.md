# Schedulr

**Schedulr** is your open-source, privacy-respecting planning assistant. It helps you actually make time for the stuff on your to-do list—without farming your data or making you subscribe to yet another productivity cult.

It’s built to run locally, be fully self-hosted, and work with tools you already use. No cloud lock-in, no weird logins, no spying.

Schedulr reads your tasks (from GitTasks, GitHub Issues, or Markdown), asks some smart questions, and helps you turn those into real, scheduled blocks on your calendar. It’s triage + planning + calendar automation—but under your control.

## What makes it different

- **Open source**: MIT licensed, inspect every line
- **Private**: Run it offline or on your own hardware
- **Self-hosted**: Deploy it to a server, Pi, or air-gapped laptop
- **Interoperable**: Works with GitHub, Markdown, CalDAV, and more

This isn’t a “smart planner” that hides your life in an AI black box. It’s a tool that helps you think clearly, plan realistically, and ship more.

---

## What it does (MVP)

- Reads tasks from GitTasks, GitHub Issues, or plain text
- Guides you through priority, time estimate, deadline, and focus level
- Helps you block out time in Google Calendar or any CalDAV-compatible calendar (like Nextcloud)
- Nudges you with optional daily summaries or check-ins

---

## What it doesn’t do

- Sell your data
- Send everything to OpenAI without your say-so
- Force you into someone else’s system
- Pretend your day has 38 hours in it

---

## Future plans

- CLI and web-based “daily planner” flow
- Offline-first PWA
- More calendar integrations (ICS, iCal, time-tracking)
- Priority matrix visualizer
- Local AI agent integration (like Glyph) for smarter nudges

---

## Pair it with

- [GitTasks](https://github.com/M0nkeyFl0wer/GitTasks) for task syncing from GitHub and Markdown
- [Tasks.org](https://tasks.org) or Nextcloud Tasks for mobile + calendar sync
- Your favorite distraction blocker
